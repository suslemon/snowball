Game developed on 2min contribs at a time

2min is the expected time taken to make any contribution to the project.
This can be:
- A single line of code
- Squashing a 2min bug
- Art asset made in 2min

Some things can't be done in 2min and that's okay but they shouldn't be required unless necessary.
